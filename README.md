## Implement a design from scratch

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You won’t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.

Here the final result:

<div align="center">
<a href="./images/result.jpg">
<img src="./images/result.jpg" width="300px">
</a>
</div>

In this project, we are asked to create the CSS styling of the HTML page of the previous project.
Using the indication provided by the figma file, I recreated the style as close as possible, the result is however not responsive.

## Requirements

- You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- You are not to use Javascript

## Mandatory Tasks

<summary>

### Task 0. Read and be familiar with Figma 
</summary>
<p>

Create an account in <a href="https://www.figma.com/fr-fr/">Figma</a> and open this <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/FfnVADRC9xgI3yiZliTBYZ/Holberton-School---Headphone-company">project</a> and “Duplicate to your Drafts” to have access to all design details.

If you can’t access to it, please find here the <a href="https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/tWEPFyHyXyNO9Xfi2Er2EA">Figma file</a>

<div align="center">
<a href="./images/figma.png">
<img src="./images/figma.png" width="300px">
</a>
</div>

Important notes with Figma:

- If your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/source-sans-pro">source-sans-pro</a> and <a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Spin-Cycle-OT">Spin-Cycle-OT</a>
- Some values are in float - feel free to round them

For this task, please write an amazing `README.md`

Interactions note:

- The web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
- Links hover/active: `#FF6565̀
- Button hover/active: `opacity: 0.9̀
- Max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page

</p>
</details>

### Task 1. Header 

Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

- Reset CSS styling
- Use variables
- Simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
- Avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
- Simple HTML structure - `div` containers are your friend!

Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: **create the header/hero piece**

Here an archive of all assets needed: <a href="https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/3/d1597894d79386c83b9b.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250216%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250216T180836Z&X-Amz-Expires=345600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=fdca1b998d1a5dc82910e484ac244aea59f4aecee6cc45c9cb648ec5318c1388">images_.zip</a>


### Task 2. "What we do..." section

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: **create the “What we do…” section**

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: <a href="https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/hbtn.intranet/uploads/misc/2020/3/7159d988278de54d859d.zip?X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Credential=AKIA4MYA5JM5DUTZGMZG%2F20250216%2Feu-west-3%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Date=20250216T180836Z&X-Amz-Expires=345600&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Signature=5118e2251a6c6d218359bc2c0d816cdba26555b599e17a7f18dbe1fad1daf071">holberton_school-icon.zip</a> Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.

### Task 3. "Our results" section 

Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: **create the “Our results” section**

Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

### Task 4. Contact us 

Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

### Task 5. Footer 

Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!

When you are done, here the result:

And you are done!

**Good job!**
